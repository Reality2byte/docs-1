# Background to packages#

A _package_ is a combination of _metadata_, _configuration_, and _software_ that is prepared in a way that a package management tool can use to properly and reliably install software and related configuration data on a computer. Some examples of package management tools include:

- [apt](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/CommandLine) on Ubuntu
- [yum](https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/5/html/Deployment_Guide/c1-yum.html) on RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/) for Python packages
- [gem](http://guides.rubygems.org/) for RubyGems

Packages are useful because their:

- Version information helps keep software up to date
- Metadata offers visibility in what's installed to which locations and why
- Software installations are reproducible in different environments.

## Package creation tools

There are many tools for creating packages. Some of these tools are provided directly by Linux distributions, while many other third-party packaging tools are also available.

Some popular package creation tools include:

- [rpmbuild](http://wiki.centos.org/HowTos/SetupRpmBuildEnvironment) (CentOS) for RPM packages. Also, refer to the [Packaging Tutorial: GNU Hello](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/package-maintainers/Packaging_Tutorial_GNU_Hello/) for Fedora
- [debuild](https://wiki.debian.org/Packaging/Intro) for deb packages
- [distutils](https://docs.python.org/2/distutils/builtdist.html) for Python packages
- [gem](http://guides.rubygems.org/make-your-own-gem/) for RubyGems packages

Some advanced package creation tools include:

- [Mock](https://rpm-software-management.github.io/mock/), a chroot-based system for building RPM packages in a clean room environment
- [pbuilder](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PbuilderHowto), a chroot-based system for building deb packages in a clean room environment. Useful tips about pbuilder can also be found in pbuilder's [user manual](http://www.netfort.gr.jp/~dancer/software/pbuilder-doc/pbuilder-doc.html)
- [git-buildpackage](http://honk.sigxcpu.org/projects/git-buildpackage/manual-html/gbp.html), a set of scripts that can be used to build deb packages directly from git repositories
- [fpm](https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm), a third-party tool that allows users to quickly and easily make a variety of packages (including RPM and deb packages)
- [PackPack](https://github.com/packpack/packpack), a simple tool to build RPM and Debian packages from git repositories.
